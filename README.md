**Front-End developer** at **Nackademin** in stockholm

[It's alive!!](https://owenjose.github.io/javascript2-second-assignment/PocketMonsterIndex.html "patience my friend")

Basically this is what i was thinkin --> (https://www.pokedex.org/)
---

## __The Idea__

I was thinkin of creating a PokéDex, meaning that i want with ease find info about one or every pokémon

Tech used:

* JS
* CSS
* jQuery
* jQueryUI

---

## __Things missing__
(except for a mastercoder)


* need to get the progress bar to disapear when done
* need to understand the 504 erro and automatically request it again.
* to be able to load lots of pokemons (I get 90 before the first 504 error)
* want to create a popUp so we can read detailed info of the pokemon both when searched for and klicked on.
* needs to be faster
* and maybe prettier
* display search result
* backgroundcolor to match pokéType
