##__The Idea__

I was thinkin of creating a PokéDex, meaning that i want with ease find info about one or every pokémon

Tech used:

* JS
* CSS
* jQuery
* jQueryUI

---

##__Things missing__
(except for a mastercoder)


* need to get the progress bar to disapear when done
* need to understand the 504 erro and automatically request it again.
* want to create a popUp so we can read detailed info of the pokemon both when searched and klicked on.
* needs to be faster
* and maybe prettier
