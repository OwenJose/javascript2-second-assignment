## __The Idea__

I was thinkin of creating a PokéDex, meaning that i want with ease find info about one or every pokémon

Tech used:

* JS
* CSS
* jQuery
* jQueryUI

Basically this is what i was aiming for [-->](https://www.pokedex.org/)

---

## __Things missing__
(except for a mastercoder)


* a progressbar or loding indicator
* adding more info in the pop-up
* and maybe prettier
* backgroundcolor to match pokéType
* adding the rest ao the pokemons
